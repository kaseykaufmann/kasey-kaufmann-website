        <p>
          My name is Kasey Kaufmann and I am a 4th year at the University of
          Florida pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to
          work outside my comfort and knowledge set.
        </p>
        <p>
          As enclosed in my resume, I have previous experience in an internship
          position at Horizon business services where I was responsible for
          searching for bugs in current software, taking notes in demos of new
          company projects, updating customer contact pages as requested using
          Preact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, for academic purposes, I am learning the MERN stack and
          working with a team in an agile based work environment to create a web
          application for a local salon.
